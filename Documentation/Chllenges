1.You encountered a database connection issue during the Gradle build of your Spring Boot project. The test SpringOneApplicationTests > contextLoads() failed with a CannotGetJdbcConnectionException, caused by a java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException, indicating a misconfigured database connection. To resolve this, you verified and corrected the database configuration in application.properties, ensured the database server was running, validated the schema, and checked the use of an embedded database for tests if applicable. After ensuring all configurations and dependencies were correct, the issue was resolved, allowing the build and tests to proceed successfully.

2.Challenge Faced: You encountered an error stating "Cannot resolve symbol 'persistence' Cannot resolve symbol 'Entity'" while working on your User entity class. This issue occurred because the necessary JPA (Java Persistence API) dependencies were missing in your project.
Solution: You resolved the issue by adding the required JPA dependencies to your project:
•	For Maven, you added dependencies for javax.persistence-api, hibernate-core, and spring-boot-starter-data-jpa.
•	For Gradle, you added equivalent dependencies for javax.persistence-api, hibernate-core, and spring-boot-starter-data-jpa.
After adding the dependencies, you rebuilt the project, which resolved the error, allowing your project to recognize JPA annotations like @Entity.
3.Summary of Challenges and Solutions:
1.	Issue with MySQL Connector Configuration:
•	Challenge: The MySQL Connector version was incompatible with Spring Boot 3.4.1, causing issues when starting the application.
•	Solution: After investigating the issue, I recommended upgrading the MySQL connector to a compatible version (8.0.26), ensuring that Spring Boot could communicate correctly with the MySQL database.
2.	Server Port Binding Error:
•	Challenge: The application failed to start due to an incorrect configuration in application.properties. Specifically, the value for server.port was malformed with a comment within the same line.
•	Solution: I advised fixing the application.properties file by moving the comment to a separate line to ensure that the server.port value was properly interpreted by Spring Boot:
server.port=8080
# Set the server port (default: 8080)
3.	Gradle Command Not Recognized:
•	Challenge: The command gradlew was not recognized in PowerShell due to the command execution policy in Windows.
•	Solution: I suggested using .\gradlew instead of gradlew to run the Gradle commands from PowerShell, as Windows PowerShell does not execute commands from the current location by default.
4.	Application Failing to Start:
•	Challenge: After addressing the previous issues, the application still failed to start, showing an error related to the Java process exiting with a non-zero status.
•	Solution: I recommended running the application with --stacktrace to gather more detailed logs, which would provide insights into the exact cause of the issue and help in troubleshooting further.
Overall Resolution Process:
1.	Upgraded the MySQL connector.
2.	Corrected the configuration issue in application.properties.
3.	Addressed the issue of unrecognized commands in PowerShell by using .\gradlew.
4.	Recommended running the application with additional logging to capture detailed error information and debug the startup issue.
This process should help in resolving the current challenges you're facing with your Spring Boot application.

Challenge Faced:
1.	Connecting the Frontend to the Backend: You needed to send and retrieve data from the backend, specifically for the vehicle entry and exit forms. For the exit form, you had to make a GET request using the token to fetch the parking details.
2.	Handling Missing or Invalid Data: In the backend, if no vehicle is found with the provided token, it was crucial to handle this scenario gracefully. Returning appropriate status codes and responses from the backend was necessary to prevent errors on the frontend.
3.	Fee Calculation Logic: You needed to calculate the parking fee based on the entry time and duration. This required converting the entry time into a proper date format and calculating the hours to compute the fee.
4.	Error Handling in API Requests: It was important to handle success and error responses from the backend properly, ensuring users get meaningful feedback, such as a clear error message if the token is invalid or if no parking details are found.

How You Solved It:
1.	Connecting the Frontend to the Backend: You used Axios in the ExitForm component to send a GET request to the backend using the vehicle token. This was done by creating an API endpoint on the backend to fetch parking details.
2.	Handling Missing or Invalid Data: On the backend, you modified the getParkingDetails method to check whether the vehicle exists for the provided token. If the vehicle is not found, you logged a message and returned a null response to handle this case. In the controller, you returned a 404 Not Found status if the token did not match any parking details.
3.	Fee Calculation Logic: You implemented a function to calculate the parking fee based on the entry time. You used JavaScript's Date object to calculate the difference between the current time and the entry time, then multiplied by ₹20 per hour to compute the fee.
4.	Error Handling in API Requests: You improved error handling on the frontend by checking if the response from the backend contains the expected data. If the token was invalid or the parking details were not found, you displayed an appropriate error message to the user.

Outcome:
•	You successfully integrated the frontend with the backend by sending and receiving data using Axios.
•	You ensured that both the backend and frontend gracefully handled errors and edge cases, providing clear feedback to the user.
•	The parking fee calculation logic was implemented correctly, taking into account the duration of parking based on the entry and exit times.
This approach allows users to seamlessly enter and exit the parking system, with the backend properly processing their requests and providing the relevant information.

Challenge:
You faced an issue while starting your frontend project with Vite. The error message indicated a problem loading the PostCSS plugin due to a file lock on base64-vlq.js in the node_modules folder, specifically under source-map-js.
Solution:
1.	Closed Applications: You ensured that no other applications, including text editors and antivirus software, were locking the file.
2.	Restarted the System: A restart helped release any file locks that were stuck.
3.	Reinstalled Dependencies: You deleted the node_modules folder and package-lock.json file, and then ran npm install to reinstall the project dependencies.
4.	Checked for Open File Handles: In case the issue persisted, you could have used the Sysinternals Handle tool on Windows to identify which process was locking the file.
5.	Verified PostCSS Config: You ensured the PostCSS configuration wasn't causing the issue.
6.	Ran Vite with Admin Privileges: You tried running the terminal as an administrator to bypass potential permission issues.
After applying these solutions, you should have resolved the file lock issue and were able to run your frontend project successfully.

Challenge Summary:
1.	Port Binding Issue:
•	Initially, when trying to test your Spring Boot application, Postman was showing a connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8082 error, indicating that the application could not connect to port 8082.
2.	Solution to Port Binding:
•	You verified that no other application was using port 8082 using the netstat command, but the Spring Boot application still couldn't bind to the port.
•	You changed the port to 8083 in the application.properties file, and restarted the application.
•	After restarting, the application started successfully on port 8083, as confirmed by the logs.
3.	Internal Server Error (500 Error):
•	After successfully changing the port and sending a POST request via Postman, you received a 500 Internal Server Error indicating that something went wrong on the server side when processing the request.
4.	Solution to Internal Server Error:
•	To troubleshoot the error, you checked the Spring Boot logs for any stack traces or error messages.
•	You verified the controller, service layer, and database configuration to ensure there were no issues with handling the request or saving data.
•	You made sure that your Parking entity was correctly mapped to the database and that the database connection was working properly.
Key Solutions:
•	Changing Port: You successfully changed the server port from 8082 to 8083 and ensured the application started correctly.
•	Identifying and Fixing Errors: You plan to look into the logs and further debug the 500 Internal Server Error by checking the controller, service, and entity configurations.
If the 500 Internal Server Error persists, you can look deeper into specific exception messages in the logs to pinpoint the exact problem (e.g., database constraints, entity mapping issues, etc.).

Summary:
Challenge Faced:
1.	You faced an issue where the backend server for your Vehicle Parking Token System was running but not responding to your POST request to http://localhost:8083/parking.
2.	The error response you received was a Whitelabel Error Page with a 404 Not Found status, indicating the backend server was running but didn't have a defined route for / or /parking.
Solution:
1.	Backend Server Verification:
•	You confirmed the Spring Boot backend server was running by checking the logs and ensuring that it started successfully on port 8083.
•	You tried accessing the root URL (http://localhost:8083/) in your browser and received a 404 Not Found, which meant the backend was responding.
2.	Verify Endpoint Mapping:
•	Upon checking, you found that the /parking endpoint was not defined in the backend code. To resolve this, you defined a controller in your Spring Boot backend with a @PostMapping("/parking") to handle the POST request to /parking.
3.	Testing the Endpoint:
•	You tested the /parking endpoint using Postman, sending a POST request with JSON data, which allowed you to confirm that the endpoint was now working as expected.
4.	Optional: Custom Root Mapping:
•	As an optional step, you mapped the root / URL to return a welcome message to prevent the Whitelabel Error Page from appearing when accessing http://localhost:8083/ directly.
After these adjustments, the backend server started responding to requests correctly, and the issue was resolved.
